I maintain holiday card lists in Google Contacts by applying labels.
Exporting the contacts with a label generates a CSV file.  This script
processes the CSV file to produce a LaTeX file that can be used to print
envelopes or labels.

Often I want to send a single card to a couple or family, but I want it
addressed to include the whole family.  I handle this by adding a custom
field to the contact with text like "Bob & Sally".

I have seen an
[issue](https://support.google.com/mail/thread/17373367/contacts-in-edit-mode-are-showing-the-4-part-of-the-zip-in-the-street-name-field-view-mode-ok?hl=en)
with contacts being corrupted by having the +4 part of a zip code moved to
the end of the street address.
